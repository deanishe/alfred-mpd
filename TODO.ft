Alfred-MPD
==========

Control an `mpd` server from Alfred.

Search library, queue/unqueue tracks, control playback.


General.todo
------------

- Set specific volume (e.g. volume 100)
- Add "other actionsâ€¦" option
    - Queue whole album
    - Browse artist
    - Browse album
- Better handling of browsing albums:
  `album:name of album` means you have to enter `track:...` to further filter. Expand query to `album:name of album any:`?
- Change query delimiter and implement "no trailing space backs up"

Bugs.todo
---------

- Escape colons in track/album names
  Better to make browsing an album a separate action?
